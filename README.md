# TetrisPlayer
Authors: Sean Foley, Bryce Lenhart
Java  program that uses a Prolog theory to play Tetris on an emulated gameboy.
Completed as my term project for Symbolic Programming class under Dr. Potter at UGA

Since the usage of the Robot class in the Java file is dependent upon screen coordinates, this implementation only works with the BGB gameboy emulator in full window mode using the baseline Tetris ROM on 1920 x 1080 Windows 7, or at least as far as I know. However, the Prolog logic is theoretically applicable to any implementation of Tetris!
